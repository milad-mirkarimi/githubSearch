## Todo
* Currently topics related sorts are front end sorts, this is not ideal when user needs to keep the state of the app, especially on page reload - susggestion would be to build custome api services to sort the list.

* All the API payloads are limited to 10 per page - add pagination in order to get all the results.

* Add sort when displaying repos
